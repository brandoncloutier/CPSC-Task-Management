# CPSC Task Management Application

A comprehensive task and project management web application built for CPSC 449. This application helps users organize their work by managing projects, tasks, and recurring activities with an intuitive interface and AI-powered features.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **User Authentication**: Secure signup, login, and password reset functionality
- **Project Management**: Create, edit, delete, and complete projects with due dates and descriptions
- **Task Management**: Add tasks to projects with urgency levels, status tracking, and due dates
- **Recurring Tasks**: Set up tasks that automatically regenerate at specified intervals (daily, weekly, monthly)
- **Archives**: View completed projects and tasks in a dedicated archive section
- **Search**: Quick search functionality to find projects by name or description
- **Account Management**: View and manage user account details

### Advanced Features
- **AI-Powered Summaries**: Get AI-generated project summaries using Groq API
- **AI Task Prioritization**: Receive AI-suggested task prioritization based on project context
- **Automated Task Generation**: Edge functions automatically create tasks from recurring task templates
- **Row-Level Security (RLS)**: Database-level security policies ensure users can only access their own data

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: 
  - HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6 Modules)
  - Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
- **Backend**: 
  - [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) (PostgreSQL database, authentication, edge functions)
- **AI Integration**: 
  - [Groq API](https://groq.com/) (Llama 3.1 8B Instant model)
- **Deployment**: 
  - Supabase Edge Functions for automated recurring task processing

## Database Schema

### Main Tables
- **`project`**: Stores project information (name, description, due date)
- **`task`**: Individual tasks associated with projects
- **`recurring_task`**: Templates for tasks that repeat automatically
- **`completed_projects`**: Archive of completed projects
- **`completed_tasks`**: Archive of completed tasks
- **`user`**: User account information

### Running the Application

1. Serve the `client` directory using a local web server (required for ES6 modules):
   ```bash
   # Using Python 3
   cd client
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Or using Node.js http-server
   npx http-server client -p 8000
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000/pages/index.html
   ```

3. Create an account or log in to get started!

## Usage

### Getting Started
1. **Sign Up**: Create a new account on the landing page
2. **Create a Project**: Navigate to Projects and click "Create Project"
3. **Add Tasks**: Open a project and add individual tasks or set up recurring tasks
4. **Track Progress**: Update task statuses as you work (`todo` → `in_progress` → complete)
5. **Use AI Features**: Click the AI button on project details for summaries and prioritization

### Recurring Tasks
- Set up recurring tasks with intervals (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Configure reminder days before the due date
- Tasks are automatically generated by the edge function when reminders are due

### Archives
- Completed projects and tasks are automatically moved to archives
- Access archives to view your completed work history

## Security

- **Authentication**: Supabase handles secure user authentication
- **Row-Level Security**: Database policies ensure data isolation between users
- **API Keys**: Keep your Supabase and Groq API keys secure (consider using environment variables in production)

## Development Notes

- The application uses ES6 modules, so it must be served over HTTP/HTTPS (not `file://`)
- All database operations use Supabase's JavaScript client library
- Edge functions run on a cron schedule to process recurring tasks
- AI features require an active Groq API key

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the application:
- Task dependencies and relationships
- Team collaboration features
- Calendar view for tasks and projects
- Email notifications for reminders
- Mobile app version
- Export/import functionality
